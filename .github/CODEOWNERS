# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies in some specific branch, then only specific team and
# not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
